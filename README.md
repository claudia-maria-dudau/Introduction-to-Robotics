Each homework's description includes:
- requirements
- files (naming must respect the standard in the requirement)
- implementation details (if aplicable)
- code
- picture of the setup
- video of the setup (if necessary or desired)

## Homework 1 - RGB LED
### Requirements
Control a RGB led by using separate potentiometers in controlling each of the colors of the led (Red, Green, Blue). The control must be done with digital electronics.

### Implementation details
Since the values read from each potentiometer are in the interval [0..1023], they need to be mapped to the accepted values by each led which are in the interval [0..255].
